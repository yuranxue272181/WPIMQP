WPI MQP Image Process Software Initial Version. This project is a basic YUV video player with OpenGL rendering. The current UI is very simple and rough (and ugly :)) and will be gradually improved over the vacations.

Basic Development Information
-
1. Language: C++
2. Applicationï¼šQT creator. 
3. Version: Qt 6.7.2 (MSVC 2019, x86_64). Built on Aug 6 2024 00:17:40. (not the LST one)

Currently Implemented Features

2. Start Button: <br>Click this button to initiate video playback or replay the current video.
3. Play/Pause Button: <br>This button is used to control the playback and pause of the video.
4. Zoom In/Zoom Out Button: <br>This buttons are used to zoom in and zoom out the video (window adaption problems remaining).

Future Improvements
-
1. UI Optimization: <br>The user interface will be redesigned and optimized in future versions to enhance the overall user experience.
2. Board Testing: <br>Once the hardware board is successfully set up, we will test the data directly from the board.
3. RGB Data Support: <br>Will convert RGB data into video if needed.
4. Feature Prioritization: <br>If any key features are identified, we will work on them earlier.

Challenges
-
1. Window adaption is difficult to achieve.
2. How to configure files on different computers.
